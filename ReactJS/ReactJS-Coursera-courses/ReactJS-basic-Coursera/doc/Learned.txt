REACT RECONCILIATION ALGORITHM
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI 
to reflect changes in the component state.
 The reconciliation algorithm is the set of rules that React uses 
 to determine how to update the UI in the most efficient way possible.



React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI. The virtual DOM is a 
lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM, which allows React to make changes to 
the UI without manipulating the actual DOM. 
This makes updates faster, as changing the virtual DOM is
 less expensive than changing the real DOM.
