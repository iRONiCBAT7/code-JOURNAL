the final project portfolio website wasn't working in react.


so first i downloaded src folder. And installed all
dependencies like chakra ui, yup ...etc.
but still didn't worked.
 error occurs - deprecated, module export problem like that.
not sure still whats gone wrong.


then i downloaded whole reactlab forlder and used the command
npm start but it didn't worked out.
so i used the commnad npm install and then used the command
npm start and it got started. 

matha kharab ho gaya tha yahan.




so now i have to start builing the project.
