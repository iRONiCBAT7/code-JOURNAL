react make it easier to build web apps

previously jquery was popular

javascript is used to create ReactJS

React can be used to develop mobile component android  and ios, VR applica..

when we install Node.js then npm comes bundled with it.

npm is all about code sharing and reuse.


Css grid 

bootstrap css framwork, quick website building, grid in Bootstrap
 is important feature 
 
so we can define layout




how to use map() method ?

List - represented in array in Javascript,  most common type it have is 
       object

with map() we can extract the data which user care about.

map() work on Array only.
we need to use array type list


Render a simple list component (transform lists of elements)

we can transform any list of item in a collection of react component


react do automatic optimization updates in your UI.

diffing algorithm used by react whenever we make changes in dom tree or 
add a new component.
and the process of updating ( vir to real dom ) is called recoliniation in react.

when we add new component at the last the efficiency decreases. because some
mutation takes place by diffing.

Here list identifiers is used to identify those component to make process
more efficiencty.

map(), filter(), sort()   function used.


Keys in list -
key is a property (prop)

Key used to indetify (unique id) which items is added, changed or removed.
or to distinguished between list itmes. 

key specify how to treat a element when updates happens (new list item added)

item index is not recommended bcs when updates happens list loses its order
(position changes and it's content lost or internal state won't be preserved
of list items).
perfromance decreases and UI glitch occures that's why.

if we use random function to generate key values or id's then it will be 
unique but when we re-render internal state won't be preserved of list itmes.


## Controlled component -

works as a Source of truth for a component

# declaravtive API
A declarative API is an application programming interface that allows developers 
to define what they want to accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it.
In a declarative API, the developer specifies the desired outcome or end state,
 and the API takes care of the underlying implementation details. 
This approach contrasts with an imperative API, 
where developers specify the exact steps required 
to achieve the desired outcome.



provide more control over the forms

<form> <fieldset> </fieldset> </form>

onSubmit, onChange, button type submit, 
button disabled, value, e.target.value
e.preventDefault();

value props is used to perform state delegation.
In React, state delegation refers to the practice of
 passing state data and state management functions 
 down to child components in a component hierarchy. 



CONTEXT API

Global State ( data or state which is used by most of the component but not
essentially by every component )

props drilling problem is solved with the use of Context API







#######  extra ###

React is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
While React does include some imperative APIs for interacting with 
the DOM (such as the ReactDOM library for rendering components to the DOM), 
the core React APIs are primarily declarative.

In React, developers define the desired UI state using 
a declarative syntax called JSX, which describes 
what the UI should look like based on the current
 state of the application. 
Developers do not need to specify how to update the 
UI in response to changes in state;
 React takes care of that automatically.
